# Estimate Electricity Cost from Grid Before Network using Population

## Finance

The amount of money needed to fund an infrastructure project includes both initial and recurring costs. The initial costs are paid upfront and the recurring costs are paid later.

The net present value or discounted cost of an infrastructure project assumes that you will invest the money that you will use later. For example, if the project costs $110k next year and if you are confident that you will earn at least 10% through capital appreciation or investment, then you can request a loan this year for $100k.

## Demography

Assume that population grows at a fixed rate each year. If the population is 100 and the growth rate is 10%, then the population will be 110 after the first year and 121 after the second year.

## Consumption

Assume that consumption is fixed per capita. Estimate consumption based on the projected population.
