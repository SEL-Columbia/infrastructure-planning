# Infrastructure Planning
Here are composable modules for planning infrastructure.

## Goals

- Make extensive use of open data from the UN and World Bank
- Have simple models with few parameters (be easy to understand)
- Leave room for future improvements (such as alternate sources of energy)

## Tools

### Forecast demographic from series
Forecast population from historical population data

### Estimate electricity consumption from series
Estimate kWh from historical consumption data

### Get electricity consumption by population curve (1/7/2016)
Generate consumption by population curve from historical consumption data by region, country, income

### Estimate electricity consumption from curve (1/7/2016)
Estimate kWh from consumption by population curve

### Estimate electricity demand (1/8/2016)
Estimate kW (formerly peak demand)

### Estimate grid electricity local cost (1/15/2016)
Estimate local cost for grid

### Estimate mini grid electricity local cost (1/28/2016)
Estimate local cost for mini-grid

### Estimate off grid electricity local cost (2/4/2016)
Estimate local cost for off-grid

### Optimize medium voltage network for cost (2/11/2016)
Optimize medium voltage network using mvMax

### Compare electrification scenarios (2/18/2016)
Compare connections, technologies, costs
